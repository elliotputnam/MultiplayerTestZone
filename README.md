# Multiplayer Test Room

A simple networked multiplayer test environment built to demonstrate basic client-server communication, real-time movement, and in-game chat between players.

## Features

- Host and join a multiplayer session over a local network
- Basic player movement (WASD)
- In-game chat with usernames
- Mouse lock for first-person-like control (ESC to release)
- Minimal UI for testing and development

## Getting Started

1. **Start the Server:**
   - Launch the application and select **Server** mode.
   - This sets up a room for other clients to connect.

2. **Start One or More Clients:**
   - On the same network, launch the application again and select **Client** mode.

3. **Controls:**
   - `W A S D` – Move the player
   - `ESC` – Unlock the mouse cursor
   - `Enter` – Input your username and send chat messages

## Chat System

- Each client can input a username on first use.
- Use the chat box to send messages to all connected players.
- Messages are synchronized across clients in real time.

## Notes

- This is a **test/demo environment**, not a complete game.
- Designed for local network testing only (LAN).
